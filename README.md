Doctrine Yaml Fixtures
===============

make your functional and regression testing as much painless as it
possible.

Make your Fixtrues from existing Data:

   1. provide your DB connection
   2. roll your fixture setup out
      - with database data
      - with dummy data
      - just with placeholders/table names


Let your Fixtures define your Data Structure:
 
   1. define your database mapping
   2. provide your DB Connection
   3. sync your mapping with DB





NB:  Doctrine does not support reverse engineering from tables that don't have a primary key.
